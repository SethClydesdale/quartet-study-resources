# Quartet Study Resources
Quartet Study Resources is a website that offers exercises for practicing what is taught in [Quartet: Intermediate Japanese Across the Four Language Skills](https://quartet.japantimes.co.jp/en/). Much like [Genki Study Resources](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/genki-study-resources), this was created to help aid those self-studying with Quartet, and if you've used its predecessor you should feel right at home!

### Using the Offline Version
If you're using the offline version you'll have to unzip the files. Once you've done that, you can access all the study resources by opening any of the **index.html** files in the browser of your choice. It should have the same experience as the online version, however, whenever new exercises/lessons are added they will not be available; you'll have to download the latest version of the repository to get them.

**If icons are broken:** If you use Firefox and icons appear broken, then please see [this topic](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/quartet-study-resources/help/broken-icons/) to resolve the issue.

**If settings will not save:** If your settings will not save, such as furigana preference or dark mode, please see [this topic](https://sethclydesdale.github.io/quartet-study-resources/help/stuck-loading/) for resolving the issue.
